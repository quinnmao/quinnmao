# Let's bring sensors to the cloud ☁️

Hi, I'm Qiwei Mao, a geotechnical engineer based in Atlanta, GA, with a passion for IoT systems. I'm exploring low-power microcontrollers and **LoRa** communication systems to enable both hobbyist remote monitoring solutions and industrial-grade monitoring or control systems.

### 🌐 My Focus Areas:
- **Geotechnical Engineering**: Harnessing IoT for smarter environmental monitoring.
- **LoRa**: Using **LoRaWAN** technology to build scalable, long-range communication systems for IoT applications.
- **ESP32**: Leveraging the powerful **ESP32** microcontroller for building cost-effective and high-performance IoT solutions.

### 🛠️ Hardware I Use:
- [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) — A versatile and powerful microcontroller for IoT applications.
- [LoRa Transceivers](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/sx1276) — Enabling long-range wireless communication for IoT.
- Arduino UNO — Classic development platform for a wide range of IoT projects.
- Raspberry Pi — For more complex IoT and server-side applications.

### 💻 Tech Stack:
- **Programming Languages**: C/C++, Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Tools**: React, RTOS, ChirpStack, Arduino
- **Tech Focus**: Low-power IoT systems, **ESP32** development, **LoRa** communication, remote data logging, and visualization.

### 🎥 Recent Projects:
